# Covid19-Data-Analysis-using-Python

In this project, I preprocessed and merged datasets to calculate needed measures and prepared them for an Analysis.
In this project, I worked with the COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University,
which consists of the data related to the cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, for each Country.
Also, we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe.
I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the virus in a country and how happy people are,
living in that country.



Results : -
Developed countries are more prone to getting the infection.


I recommend you to go through the codes which is easy and very basic for beginners.
